# Notes app for mobile

Demo here: [https://kortaggio.github.io/mobile-notes](https://kortaggio.github.io/mobile-notes)

Built with Backbone.js, jQuery, and Bootstrap.

This is a client-side app serving static assets, so you can simply run from the root folder with an HTTP fileserve. You can use any language for this but I like python because it's easy:

    $ python -m SimpleHTTPSever
